" Passes the control sequence [1][2] `seq` through GNU `screen` to the

function! termcwd#screen#SendCtrlSeq(seq) abort
    " Package `seq` into a Device Control String sequence by converting
    " ESC \ to ESC ESC \ ESC P \ and bookending with ESC P and ESC \.
    " (Quoting hell compels me to spell this out.)
    "
    " This seems poorly documented.  The `screen` manual [3] mentions
    " that DCS '[o]utputs a string directly to the host terminal without
    " interpretation' but says nothing about handling embedded ESC \.
    " After skimming the source [4], I wrongly concluded that it was
    " sufficient to imitate tmux and convert ESC to ESC ESC.  I realized
    " my mistake upon coming across a more general implementation in
    " Koichi Murase's ble.sh [5] that works within nested `screen`
    " instances (while mine didn't).  (I don't really understand why
    " Murase's approach works but mine didn't.  Maybe one day I'll
    " close-read the `screen` source, but that day is not today.)

    " Use a double-quoted literal for the substitute() replacement
    " argument because '\e' is not interpreted as ESC there.
    let l:seq = substitute(a:seq, '\C\e\\', "\e\e\\\\\eP\\\\", 'g')
    let l:seq = "\eP" . l:seq . "\e\\"
